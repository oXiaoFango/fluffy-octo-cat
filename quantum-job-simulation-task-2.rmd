## 1. Define the Problem / Objective:

#### Objective:

To evaluate the impact of the new trial layouts on the performance of selected trial stores compared to control stores. Provide data-driven recommendation to each location regarding whether the trial layout should be rolled out to all stores.

#### Key Focus Areas:

1.  Select control stores

-   Explore data and define metrics for selecting control stores
-   Consider factors that make a store suitable as control store
-   Visualize these metrics to ensure their suitability

2.  Assessment of the Trial:

-   Evaluate each trial store individually in comparison with its respective control store
-   Gain insights into the overall performance of each store

3.  Collate Findings:

-   Summarise the findings for each store, including key performance metrics and insights.
-   Provide a clear recommendation for each location based on the impact on sales

## 2. Data Collection

The data is given in csv files.

1.  QVI data - This dataset is the output of Task 1, consist of transactions from Jul 2018 to Jun 2019 and details about loyal customers.

```{r - Loading required libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(writexl)
```

```{r - Loading excel file}
QVI_data <- read_excel("/kaggle/input/quantum-job-simulation-dataset/QVI_data.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet1")
```

##### Data Observation - Customer Data

1.  There are total 246,740 observations and 15 variables.
2.  There is no NA data in the dataset.

```{r - Data Observation - QVI Data, echo=FALSE}
##### Data Observation - QVI Data
head(QVI_data)
any(is.na(QVI_data))
```

## 3. Data Cleaning

There is no data cleaning is required as QVI_data is an output from Task 1.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis:

```{r - EDA - Setting up theme, include=FALSE}

theme_set(theme_classic())
theme_update(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

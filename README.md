- 👋 Hi, I’m @oXiaoFango. I'm from Malaysia and currently living in Switzerland.
- 👀 I'm from Computer Science and I’m interested in Data Science and Data Analytic currently.
- 🌱 I’m now learning Google Data Analytic at Coursera. After the course, I will continue with Tableau and R.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a simple project to hands on with Data Analytics. Any guidance is much appreciated.
- 🧘🏻‍♀️ I enjoy doing yoga and hiking. Recently, I try to cook South East Asian food because I'm far away from home. 
- 📫 How to reach me: xiaofang.teng@gmail.com. Feel free to reach out to me for a short chat.
